StreetHub is having another Independent retailer event next month. I was asked for help design the flyer. I suggested redesigning it.

## Branding

Ever since our iPhone app initiated a rebranding, our website and newsletter have followed. It's time to tackle the **print** stuff.

What the rebranding basically comprises is:

* an additional font: **Vollkorn**
* fewer colors
* more shades of grey
* a **dominant** color: our flagship **red**

Updating the graphics and typography is rather quick, and redesigning obviously entails more than visual updates.

<!-- ## Simplifying

Without going as far as strictly sticking to St Exupery's famous quote, it does makes sense to remove superfluous elements. There weren't many of them:

* the logo's arrow
* the tagline
* the QR code -->

## The obvious on the front

The main issue I had with the initial layout was how the information was presented.

I kept the good parts:

* starting with the logo
* having a clear title
* putting most of the text on the back

I like to ask (and answer) straightforward questions when designing anything. And they're often the same ones:

* Who? StreetHub
* What? Independent retailer meet-up.
* When? Thursday 5th February, 7pm.
* Where? Rainmaking Loft.

I believe it makes sense for an **event** to provide all these *basic* informations on the **front** of the invite. There is still enough secondary information to fill up the back.

## Layout, contrast and emphasis

By just using text, the 3 most basic ways to add **depth** is by playing with the weight, the color, and the size.

* the event's **name** is granted the biggest size and the dominant color
* the **date** has a calendar visual format

Compare these 2 images:

The difference is very light but the 2nd version conveys the message the way it's meant to be both read and understood. With subtle visual clues, you can draw the eye and thus the reader's attention.














It actually took me more time to write this post. It's not much. Just common sense. I believe can go a long way.
