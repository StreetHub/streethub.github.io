On the [StreetHub blog](http://blog.streethub.com/), Luciana has been writing several area guides, covering different areas of London.

## Content first

A prerequisite to any decent design is to establish a clear **purpose** for an already defined **content**. In the case of an area guide, the goal is simple: provide a guided tour of an interesting neighbourhood by mentioning its distinctive features, including the StreetHub boutiques that characterize the area.

The [blog layout](http://blog.streethub.com/post/82393102562/area-guide-to-shoreditch) doesn't lend itself to delivering a reasonable experience: the text flow is linear, the 1-column structure basic, the media isolated.

I just asked myself how *I* would like to browse a guide comprising images, short descriptions and a variety of content types. The answer lied in a **3-column** layout.

## Vertical and horizontal browsing

I love high **information density** in an interface. It provides a quick overview of what content is available, and makes sense for a **menu** which also acts as a table of contents.

To make it both less boring and meaningful, I differentiated the menu items through weight and color:

* section headings
